--------------------
Each game will start with 5 players. Each player will pick a number from 0 to 100. 
The average value of all numbers is multiplied by 0.8 (or 4/5). 
The player whose number is closest to the product, wins the round.
All players begin with 10 points. Each round, all losers will lose 1 point. 
If a player's points reach 0, they are eliminated (cue the acid!!)
Each time a player is elminated, new rules are implemented. 



4 players remaining
---------------------
If two or more players choose the same number, those players lose a point.

3 players remaining
---------------------
If a player's number matches the product exactly, the loser penality is doubled.

2 players remaining
----------------------
If a player chooses 0, the player that chooses 100 wins the round.
